# eBay Web Scraper
Allows you to enter search term(s) and recieve a dataset of product info scraped from eBay.
I use this to build datasets to practice data science/market analysis

# Usage
Check requirements for packages to install


If you are on Windows, the requirements also have the commands for setting up a venv and installing the needed packages

Datasets are stored as .json files in the Datasets folder.

Run the main.py file to start the GUI scraper.
Be aware, there are probably many bugs and some things aren't implemented yet. I need some more time for that @~@
