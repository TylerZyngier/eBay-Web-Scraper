# eBay Web Scraper
Allows you to enter search term(s) and recieve a dataset of product info scraped from eBay.
I use this to build datasets to practice data science/market analysis

I'm still working to add more features and improve the UX.

# Usage
Check requirements for packages to install

If you are on Windows, the requirements also have the commands for setting up a venv and installing the needed packages

Run the main.py file to start the GUI scraper.
Be aware, there are probably many bugs and some things aren't implemented yet. I need some more time for that @~@
